### Social Media Shares

1.  **Andrej Karpathy's** latest podcast is nothing short of a "thought explosion," where he dropped a series of groundbreaking ideas like "**We are in the decade of agents**" and "**Forgetting is a feature, not a bug**" ü§Ø. He posits that humanity's poor memory forces us into abstract thinking, while LLMs' perfect memory paradoxically hinders generalization. Perhaps what we need aren't larger models, but models better at "forgetting." These [Highlights Compiled by orange.ai (AI News)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1979704983265456362) have sparked profound reflections on the very nature of AI ü§î.<br/>![AI News: Karpathy Podcast Core Views](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k7yhg3k6e60rdsjywxdama3k.avif)

2.  The AI community witnessed a "major blunder" over the weekend when an **OpenAI researcher** grandly announced that GPT-5 had "solved" 10 long-unanswered math problems, only for it to be revealed that it merely retrieved existing literature üòÇ. DeepMind's CEO escalated the situation with a simple, "That's embarrassing," while LeCun sharply ridiculed the self-inflicted wound, leading to the eventual deletion of the related tweets. Baoyu's [Gossip Summary (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/1979640848041071097) provides a full recap of this PR disaster, triggered by an overstatement of AI capabilities.<br/>![AI News: Screenshots of the GPT-5 Math Problem Debacle](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k7yhg756fmcvesq5gqs37pg3.avif)

3.  The leap in **AI Agent capabilities** isn't about model intelligence; it's about the "**cognitive processes**" designed for them! An [In-depth Article (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tewBKHgbyrjxUjAOmkXI7A) shared by a former Manus team member highlights that structured processes like planning, iteration, and interaction can effectively counteract LLM's divergent thinking and forgetting. This article, recommended by ginobefun, profoundly reveals that we're shifting from pursuing LLMs' one-off "fast thinking" to designing verifiable "slow thinking," trading more computational steps for higher certainty results üí°.

4.  Just how realistic are AI-generated ASMR sounds? **Higgsfield AI's** latest work redefines "realism," producing whispers, breathing sounds, and other subtle audio effects that are virtually indistinguishable from human-made ones ü§Ø. This [Reddit Hot Post (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1oapvpe/this-asmr-isnt-human-higgsfield-ai-just-redefined/) sparked heated discussion: when AI can simulate such nuanced human sensory experiences, how far are we from AI that can "feel" emotions? ü§î<br/>![AI News: Higgsfield AI Redefines "Realism"](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k7yhgaaafn4rhswhf2mcqwwk.avif)

6.  Are **AI summaries** killing deep learning? Yubo shared his reflections, believing that AI summaries are like "watching a movie in five minutes"‚Äîefficient but losing the richness of original information and personal perspective ü§î. He cited Karpathy's podcast view, emphasizing that original content is the "yeast" and users are the "dough"; true understanding needs time to "ferment." This [Thought-Provoking Post (AI News)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/68f452243ea7571a78e788ca) reminds us that AI's ceiling still lies with humans, urging us not to let the convenience of tools replace the depth of thought.

7.  Generate an interactive 3D world in just 7 seconds! The open-source model **FlashWorld** has achieved astonishing breakthroughs in speed and quality, rapidly generating high-quality 3D Gaussian splatting from a single image or a sentence ü´®.
