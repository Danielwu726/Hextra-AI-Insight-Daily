### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **A new study**, detailed in [New Research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20957), reveals that large language models (LLMs) exhibit "bias" in the investment sector. When conducting investment analysis, LLMs generally show a preference for tech stocks, large-cap stocks, and contrarian investment strategies. üìâ Even more concerning, when presented with evidence contradicting their inherent biases, these models display strong "confirmation bias," stubbornly sticking to their initial views. This research serves as a wake-up call: when applying AI in high-stakes fields like finance, it's crucial to be vigilant and quantify its intrinsic biases; otherwise, "your AI" might not be giving "your opinion." üö©

2.  **Learning to Detect (LoD)**, a new research detailed in [New Research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15430), proposes a universal detection framework for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Facing an endless stream of jailbreak attacks, how do we build a "universal firewall" for LVLMs? üöß LoD shifts focus from learning specific attack "moves" to learning the "safety concepts" of the task itself. This approach allows LoD to efficiently and accurately detect unknown jailbreak attacks, providing a more generalized solution for the secure deployment of LVLMs. üîí

3.  **MotionScript**, a framework detailed in [Framework (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12634), provides the answer to making AI precisely understand and generate expressive human movements. This framework converts complex 3D human motions into structured natural language descriptions, capturing every detail from emotion to style. üé® This not only provides high-quality training data for Text-to-Motion models but also enables LLMs to generate entirely new actions beyond existing datasets. This work builds a bridge from language to action for animation, virtual human simulation, and robotics. ü§ñ
