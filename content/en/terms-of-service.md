# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "**the Site**" or "**we**"). Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying "I agree" to these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
**The Site** offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up, some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Account
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **don't** transfer or share your account â€“ it's a no-go!
- **The Site** has the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they're found violating these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are processed through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, the Site doesn't store your payment info.
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and let us know why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo with a subscription, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally mandated.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without permission â€“ that's a big no-no.
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading.
- **For commercial use or extensive citations**, please reach out to the Site to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **It's strictly forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes upon others' rights.
- **It's also forbidden** to mass-download, scrape, or crack member content using technical means. Seriously, play fair!
- **The Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or ditch any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up.
- **The Site** **isn't liable for compensation** if content is temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just happen, you know?

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by the Site** is purely for reference and **doesn't constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, or whatnot).
- **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using its content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties. If negotiations hit a wall, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
