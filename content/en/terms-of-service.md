# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "**the Site**" or "**we**"). Before you dive into our services, please make sure to read these Terms of Service carefully. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying 'Yep, I agree!' to everything here. Let's get started!

## 1. Service Introduction
**The Site** is all about giving you awesome paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interactions – the whole shebang! Just a heads-up, some of that cool content is only for our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **To get an account**, you'll need to give us a valid email address and set up a password. Keep it safe!
- **You** are fully responsible for keeping your account secure and for all the activity happening under it. Seriously, no transferring or sharing your account – that's a big no-no!
- If **you** break these terms, we might have to hit pause or even stop your account altogether. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are billed monthly or annually – you'll see the exact cost clearly laid out on the checkout page. No surprises!
- **All payments** go through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, we don't ever store your payment info on our end.
- **Your subscription** will conveniently auto-renew, so you don't miss a beat! Unless, of course, you decide to cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Got buyer's remorse?** For first-time subscribers, we've got a cool **14-day refund policy**! If you're not thrilled with the service within 14 days of purchase, just hit us up via the contact email at the bottom of these terms and tell us why. Heads up: this full refund offer is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are generally non-refundable unless the law absolutely insists.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All the original content** you find here? That's copyrighted by us, **the Site (hubtoday)**. So, no unauthorized copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes, okay?
- **You** get a non-exclusive, non-transferable pass to access this content strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
- Thinking about using our stuff for **commercial purposes** or quoting it a lot? Awesome! Just reach out to us first to get permission.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Here's the deal with user behavior**: **You're totally forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading anything illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or stuff that steps on other people's rights. Let's keep it positive!
- Also, **no sneaky bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to hack** into our member content using technical tricks. Not cool, and totally off-limits!
- If we spot anything funky or someone breaking the rules, **we** have the right to zap that inappropriate content and even ban the offending user. Play nice!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **Heads-up on service changes**: **We** reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop any part or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up beforehand. Just how things go sometimes!
- If **content** becomes temporarily unavailable due to things we can't control – like an act of God, a server hiccup, or a third-party service going down – **we** won't be on the hook for any compensation. Bummer, but true.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **Our disclaimer is simple**: **The information we provide** here is purely for your reference. It's definitely not professional advice – so don't take it as financial, legal, medical, or any other kind of expert guidance.
- **We** also can't be held responsible for any direct or indirect losses you might run into from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **Let's talk law**: **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted according to the awesome laws of California, USA, ignoring any conflict of law principles. West Coast vibes!
- **Got a beef?** Any disputes that pop up from or relate to these terms should first be sorted out with a friendly chat between us. If we can't hash it out, then you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Home turf!

- **Got questions about these terms?** Don't hesitate to hit us up!
