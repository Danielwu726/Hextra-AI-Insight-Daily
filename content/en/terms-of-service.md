# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025* 🗓️

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll just call "the Site" or "we" from now on)! 🎉 Before you dive into all the cool stuff we offer, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By poking around or using our services, you're essentially saying "Yup, I'm good with these terms!" 😉

## 1. About Our Service
**The Site** dishes out a ton of awesome paid subscription content and member services. Think blog posts, exclusive goodies, e-books, and lively community interaction, to name a few. Just a heads-up, some of the really good stuff is only for our subscribed members. 🤫

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To get started, **users** will need to hook us up with a valid email address and pick a password to set up their account. Easy peasy!
*   Your account, your responsibility! **Users** are totally on the hook for keeping their account secure and for anything that happens under their login. Oh, and absolutely **no transferring or sharing your account** – that's a big no-no! 🚫
*   If someone plays fast and loose with these terms, **the Site** has the right to **suspend or even terminate** their account. Just sayin'. 🚨

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   So, **subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually. Don't worry, all the pricing deets are super clear on the checkout page. No surprises! 💰
*   When it comes to **all payments**, we use awesome third-party platforms like Stripe and PayPal. This means we never, ever store your sensitive payment info on our end. Your security is key! 🔐
*   Heads up! **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you hit that cancel button before your current billing cycle wraps up. Don't want it? Cancel it in time! 🔄
*   Alright, let's talk about **our 14-day refund policy**. If you're a first-time subscriber and you're just not feeling it within 14 days of your purchase, no sweat – you can totally snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the bottom of these terms) and tell us what's up. Each user gets *one* shot at this refund. After that 14-day window or if it's not your first rodeo, we generally say **no refunds**, unless the law literally drags us into it. 💸

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   Just a quick note: **all original content** here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so. Play fair! ✨
*   What do **users** get? A **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our stuff purely for personal learning and reading. It's for you, and only you, for personal growth! 🧠
*   **For commercial use or if you want to quote a lot** of our material, please hit us up to get authorization. We're usually pretty cool about it, just ask! 📧

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   On our platform, it's **strictly forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things positive and lawful, okay? 🙏
*   Also, it's a big **no-no** to bulk download, scrape, or try to hack into member content using any sneaky technical means. Seriously, don't do it! 🙅‍♀️
*   **The Site** absolutely has the right to yank down any inappropriate content and even **ban users who break the rules**. We keep our community clean! 🧹

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   Just so you know, **we** reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, and we might not give you a heads-up. That's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
*   If, by some crazy twist of fate (like force majeure, a server glitch, or a third-party service deciding to take a nap), our content becomes temporarily unavailable, **this Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation. Bummer, but true! 🚧

## 7. Disclaimer
*   Quick disclaimer: **the info you find on this Site** is purely for reference. It's **not** professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so please don't treat it as such! 🚫📚
*   If you happen to suffer any direct or indirect losses because you used our content or services, **this Site** is pretty much off the hook. We're not liable for those kinds of bumps in the road! 🙅‍♂️

## 8. Governing Law
*   Okay, legal stuff! **These Terms of Service** are gonna be ruled by and interpreted according to the laws of California, USA. We're keeping it simple and not diving into those tricky "conflict of law" principles. ⚖️
*   **Any disputes** that pop up because of or relating to these terms? Let's try to chat it out and solve it amicably first! If we can't sort things out that way, then you agree that the courts in Santa Clara County, California, will be the place to settle things. 🤝
