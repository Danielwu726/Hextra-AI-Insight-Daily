# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "the Site" or "we"). Before you get started, we kindly ask you to carefully read through these Terms of Service. Your access or use of the Site means you agree to and accept these terms. So, let's get into it! 👇

## 1. About Our Services

The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions, to name a few. Just a heads up, some of this awesome content is only accessible to our subscribers. ✨

## 2. User Registration & Account

*   **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Once your account is set up, you're responsible for its security and all activities that happen under it. Seriously, don't even think about transferring or sharing your account – that's a big no-no! 🚫
*   **The Site** holds the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms. So, play nice! 😉

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

*   **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, and all fees are clearly shown on the checkout page. Payments are handled securely through third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal; don't worry, we don't store your payment info.
*   **Your subscription** will *automatically renew* unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends. Keep an eye on that! 🔔
*   **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: if you're a first-time subscriber and not totally thrilled with our services, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why. Heads up, though – each user gets only *one* refund opportunity. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, payments are *non-refundable*, unless the law explicitly says otherwise. ⚖️

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property

*   **All original content** on this site is *copyrighted by us* (hubtoday). So, yeah, no unauthorized copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without permission – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
*   **Users** get a *non-exclusive, non-transferable access right* to our content, purely for personal learning and reading. It's all yours to enjoy personally!
*   **Commercial use** or extensive quoting? If that's what you're after, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization. We're happy to chat! 😊

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

*   **Users**, listen up! It's *strictly forbidden* to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Basically, let's keep it clean and respectful! 👍
*   Also, **it's a no-go** to mass download, scrape, or crack member content using technical tricks. We've got our eyes on you! 👀
*   **The Site** reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and *ban* users who break these rules. Play by the rules, or face the consequences! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

*   **We** hold the right to change, suspend, or stop any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Life happens, and so do service adjustments! 🔄
*   **The Site** won't be held liable for any damages if content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control, like acts of nature, server issues, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just break, ya know? 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer

*   **The information** provided on this Site is purely for general reference. It's *not* professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so please don't treat it as such! 🚫
*   **The Site** *won't be responsible* for any direct or indirect losses users might experience from using our content or services. Basically, use your best judgment! 🤔

## 8. Governing Law

*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California law is the boss here! 👑
*   **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms? First, let's try to sort it out friendly-friendly. If we can't hug it out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let the legal eagles fly! 🦅
