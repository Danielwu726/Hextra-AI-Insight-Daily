# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll call it "**This Site**" or "**We**" for short). Please give these Terms of Service a good read before diving into our services. By accessing or using This Site, you're agreeing to and accepting these terms. ✨

## 1. About Our Services

**This Site** provides users with awesome paid subscription content and member services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and cool community interactions. Heads up: some content is only for our subscribers! 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts

*   **Users** must provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for the security of their accounts and everything that happens with them. Transferring or sharing accounts? That's a **big no-no**! 🚫
*   **This Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms. So play nice!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

*   **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis. You'll see all the juicy details about fees clearly stated on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** are processed through trusted third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't sweat it, This Site doesn't store any of your payment info! 🔒
*   **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. So keep an eye on that!
*   **Our 14-day refund policy** offers a full refund to first-time subscribers if they're not thrilled with the service within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us what's up. Each user gets one shot at this refund. If it's been more than 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, then **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless the law specifically says otherwise. Tough cookies! 🍪

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property

*   **All original content** is **copyrighted by This Site (hubtoday)**. Copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without our authorization? Not cool! Please don't. 🙏
*   **Users** are granted only a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. It's for you, not for resale!
*   **For commercial use or extensive citation**, please reach out to This Site to get proper authorization. We're usually pretty friendly!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

*   **Users are strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes upon anyone else's rights. Let's keep it clean! 😇
*   **Bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking member content** via technical means is **absolutely prohibited**. Seriously, don't even try. 🙅‍♀️
*   **This Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. You mess up, you get kicked out! 👋

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

*   **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Life happens, and so do service updates!
*   **This Site** **is not liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to things like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just out of our hands. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer

*   **The information provided by This Site** is for reference only. It **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Always consult a pro for that!
*   **This Site** **is absolutely not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Use your brain, folks! 🧠

## 8. Governing Law

*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. West Coast best coast! 🌴
*   **Any disputes arising from or related to these terms** should first be sorted out by friendly negotiation between the parties. If we can't hug it out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the competent courts in Santa Clara County, California. See you in court! (Hopefully not!) 🏛️
