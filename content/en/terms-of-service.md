*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

ðŸ‘‹ **Welcome to ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we" from now on)! Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our site, you're agreeing to them, simple as that!

## 1. Service Overview
**Our Site** offers paid subscription content and member services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Just a heads-up, some of our content is only available to subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
**Users** need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account. **You**, as a user, are fully responsible for your account's security and all activities under it â€“ and **don't even think about** transferring or sharing your account! If you ever violate these terms, **we reserve the right to suspend or terminate** your account, just like that.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
**Our subscription services** are billed monthly/annually, with fees clearly laid out on the checkout page. **All payments** are processed via third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal), so don't worry, we don't store your payment info. Your subscription will **auto-renew** unless you cancel it before the current billing cycle ends. Speaking of which, we have a **14-day refund policy** ðŸ’¸: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally thrilled with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Heads up, each user gets only one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first subscription, **no refunds** will be issued unless mandated by law.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
**All original content** on this site is **copyrighted by hubtoday**. You simply can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission. **Users** are granted a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access this content for personal learning and reading only. If you're looking to use it commercially or need to cite a big chunk, please reach out to us for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
**Users are strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Also, **don't even think about** bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking our member-only content using technical means. If you violate these rules, **we reserve the right to remove inappropriate content and ban offending users.**

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
**We reserve the right** to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. If content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to unforeseen circumstances like force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, **our Site will not be liable for compensation.**

## 7. Disclaimer
**The information provided by this Site** is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical). **Our Site will not be held responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users due to the use of our content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
**These Terms of Service** shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising out of or related to these terms shall first be resolved through friendly negotiation; if that doesn't work out, **you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts** in Santa Clara County, California.
