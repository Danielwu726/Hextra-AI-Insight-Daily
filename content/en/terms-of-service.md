# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there, and welcome to **ai.hubtoday**! 🚀 (from here on out, "the Site" or "us"). Before you jump into using our awesome services, please take a moment to carefully read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying "Yep, I agree!" to all these terms. Got it? 👍

## 1. Services Overview
**The Site** is your go-to spot for paid subscription content and exclusive member services. We're talking killer blog posts, secret resources, cool e-books, and even some community fun! 🥳 Just a heads-up: some of the extra special stuff is only for our subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To get your account set up, **you'll need** a valid email address and a solid password. Easy peasy! ✨
*   **Your account** is your responsibility! Keep it secure and own all the activity under it. Oh, and absolutely **no sharing or transferring** your account, okay? That's a big no-no! 🚫
*   If **you** break any of these terms, **the Site** totally has the right to **suspend or even terminate** your account. Just sayin'! 😬

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Our subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually. Don't worry, all the costs are super clear on the checkout page. No surprises! 💸
*   **All payments** go through trusted third-party platforms (think Stripe or PayPal). Good news: **we never store your payment info** on our end! Your security is paramount. 🔒
*   **Your subscription** will **automatically renew** – handy, right? But if you want to bail, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Otherwise, it'll just keep going! 😉
*   **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet! If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. We get it! 😌 Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the end of these Terms) and tell us why you're looking for a refund. Easy peasy! Heads up: **each user** gets one shot at that refund. If you're not a first-timer or it's been more than 14 days, then sorry, folks – **no refunds** after payment, unless the law specifically says otherwise. Fair's fair! ⚖️

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **All the awesome original content** you find here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't just copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial stuff without getting our go-ahead first. Play nice! ✨
*   **You (our users)** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content for your personal learning and reading enjoyment. It's all for you, individually! 🧠
*   Wanna use our stuff for commercial gigs or drop a ton of citations? **Hit up the Site** to get permission first. We're usually pretty cool, just ask! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Let's keep it clean, folks! **You are absolutely forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't be that person. 🙅‍♀️
*   **Trying to use tech tricks** to mass download, crawl, or crack our member content? Yeah, that's a hard **NO**. Don't even think about it! 🛑
*   **The Site** has the full right to yank any inappropriate content and **give violating users the boot**. We're not messing around! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** might change things up, hit pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
*   If stuff goes temporarily offline because of crazy acts of nature, server meltdowns, or third-party hiccups, **the Site won't be on the hook for any compensation**. We'll do our best, but sometimes things are just out of our hands. 💨

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **All the info you get from the Site** is purely for reference. Think of it as helpful tidbits, **not** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Always consult a pro for that! 🧐
*   **The Site** is **not responsible** if you run into any direct or indirect losses from using our content or services. Just keeping it real! 🚧

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are all about the laws of California, USA. We're playing by their rules, no weird legal conflicts here! 🇺🇸
*   Got a beef about these Terms? **Let's try to chat it out nicely first!** 🤝 If we can't sort it, then **you're agreeing** to take things to the proper courts in Santa Clara County, California. Hope it doesn't come to that! 🙏
