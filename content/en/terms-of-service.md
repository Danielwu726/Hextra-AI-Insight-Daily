# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (also known as "**the Site**" or "**we**")! Before you dive into our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By accessing or using the Site, you're giving us the thumbs up and agreeing to these terms. 👍

## 1. A Quick Intro to Our Services
**Our Site** is all about bringing you awesome paid subscription content and membership services. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, community interaction, and more! Just a heads-up: some content is exclusively for our subscribers. ✨

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register their account.
- **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all the happenings under their login. Seriously, folks, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else. 🚫
- **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or even terminate** a user's account if they decide to play fast and loose with these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see the exact fees crystal clear on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are handled securely through third-party platforms (think Stripe or PayPal). Just so you know, **the Site** doesn't store any of your payment info – your financial deets are safe elsewhere! 😉
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** – super convenient, right? But if you want to bail, just make sure you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet! If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: each user gets one shot at this refund. If it's been more than 14 days or you're not a first-timer, then unless the law explicitly tells us otherwise, payments are generally **non-refundable** after that. 💸

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our express permission. So, play nice! 😉
- **Users** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** – strictly for personal learning and reading, folks. No funny business!
- **If you need it for commercial use or extensive citation**, just hit up **the Site** to get our authorization. We're usually pretty cool, just ask first!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Absolutely forbidden** is uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it respectful, okay? 🙅‍♀️
- **Also a big no-no** is trying to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content using any sneaky technical tricks. Seriously, don't even try it. 🛑
- **The Site** totally has the right to yank any inappropriate content and **ban users** who don't play by the rules. Consider yourself warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, and yep, we might not give you a heads-up. It's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
- **If unforeseen circumstances, server glitches, or third-party service outages** mean you can't temporarily access content, **the Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation. Sometimes things just happen beyond our control, you know?

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by the Site** is purely for reference. Seriously, it **does not count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, and so on). Always check with a pro for that stuff! 🧐
- **The Site** **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are all about the laws of the State of California, USA, and will be interpreted based on them, without getting tangled up in any conflict of law principles. So, California law rules! ⚖️
- **For any disputes arising from or related to these terms**, both parties should try to sort things out nicely through friendly negotiation first. If that doesn't work, you're agreeing to let the courts in Santa Clara County, California, handle it. Fair enough, right?
