# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as ‚Äú**the Site**‚Äù or ‚Äú**we**‚Äù)! üëã Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you‚Äôre basically saying you agree to and accept these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
So, what's on offer? **The Site** provides users with paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, awesome blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and vibrant community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of this cool content is only for our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To get started, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
- Your account security is on you! Users are responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing** your account.
- **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Good news: subscription services are billed on either a monthly or annual basis, and the fees are always clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- All payments are handled securely through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, **the Site** doesn't store any of your payment information.
- Heads up! Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** for first-time subscribers is pretty straightforward: if you're not totally satisfied within 14 days of purchase, you can request a full refund. Just hit us up via the email provided at the end of these terms, and tell us why you're looking for a refund. Each user gets one refund opportunity. For anything beyond 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless the law absolutely demands it.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content you find here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please, no copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without our authorization.
- Users are granted a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** solely for personal learning and reading.
- If you're eyeing our content for commercial use or want to cite us extensively, please reach out to **the Site** for proper authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Seriously, don't** upload, publish, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights.
- It is **strictly prohibited** to use technical means for mass downloading, scraping, or cracking our membership content. That's just not cool.
- **The Site** reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. You've been warned! üòâ

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Life happens! We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without giving you prior notice.
- **The Site** **is not liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. We'll do our best, though!

## 7. Disclaimer
- Just so we're clear: the information provided by **the Site** is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical). Always consult a pro for that!
- **The Site** is **not responsible for** any direct or indirect losses incurred by users due to their use of the Site's content or services. Use at your own discretion!

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without messing with its conflict of law principles.
- Any disputes that pop up from or relate to these terms should first be sorted out through friendly negotiation between us. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
