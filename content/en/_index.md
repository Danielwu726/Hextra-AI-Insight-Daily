4.  AI is stepping into a "creation" phase! World Labs just dropped **RTFM**, a real-time generative world model that can continuously churn out a "realistic virtual world" with just one H100 GPU! Unlike traditional 3D modeling, RTFM learns directly from images and predicts multi-view images, building a spatially continuous world that users can explore in real-time. As the [Official Introduction (AI News)](https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog/rtfm) highlights, this marks a huge shift in generative AI from "image generation" to "world modeling," opening up endless possibilities for gaming, VR/AR, and digital twins! üéÆ

### Cutting-edge Research

1.  Large models might have "biases" in the investment game! A [New Research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20957) paper spills the tea, revealing that LLMs, when analyzing investments, generally lean towards tech stocks, large-cap stocks, and contrarian investment strategies. Even worse, when faced with evidence that contradicts their biases, these models exhibit strong "confirmation bias" and stubbornly stick to their guns. This study serves as a wake-up call: when using AI in high-stakes fields like finance, we *must* be vigilant and quantify its inherent biases, otherwise, "your AI" might not be giving "your opinion." üëÄ

2.  How do we build a "universal firewall" for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) against endless jailbreak attacks? A [New Research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15430) titled **Learning to Detect (LoD)** proposes a general detection framework. Instead of learning specific attack "moves," LoD learns to identify the "safety concepts" of the task itself. This approach allows LoD to efficiently and accurately detect unknown jailbreak attacks, providing a more generalized solution for secure LVLM deployment. üîí

3.  How can AI accurately understand and generate expressive human movements? The **MotionScript** [Framework (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12634) has the answer! It transforms complex 3D human motions into structured natural language descriptions, capturing every detail from emotion to style. This not only feeds high-quality training data to Text-to-Motion models but also enables LLMs to generate brand-new movements beyond existing datasets. This work bridges the gap between language and motion for animation, virtual human simulation, and robotics. ü§ñ

### Industry Outlook and Social Impact

1.  An epic AWS outage brought half the global internet to its knees! Major services like Perplexity, Slack, and Canva all went down, once again highlighting the fragility of overly centralized global cloud services. As [Netizen Complaints (AI News)](https://t.me/hackernews100cn/13688) whined, when all your eggs are in one basket, a tiny bump can trigger a digital "earthquake"! üí•

2.  Visual China, sitting on a goldmine of **700 million** compliant data assets, has successfully landed model training contracts with top AI companies like Alibaba and Microsoft, officially becoming the "data arms dealer" of the AI era! This collaboration underscores that high-quality, commercially viable, and traceable data is now an indispensable core resource in the AI large model race. As [This Report (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22092) points out, Visual China is leveraging its massive data empire to snag a critical position in the AI industry chain, steering the sector towards compliant development. üìà

3.  Former President Trump posted a totally bizarre AI-generated video showing himself air-dropping excrement on protesters, sparking a huge online buzz. This [News (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ob3byr/trump_posts_bizarre_ai_video_in_which_he_airdrops/) once again demonstrates AI's powerful (and weird) potential in political propaganda and information warfare. As generative AI becomes readily accessible, discerning truth from falsehood and tackling information manipulation has become a serious challenge for society as a whole. ü§î<br/>![AI News: Screenshot of AI Video Posted by Trump](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k811qyewf8p988wmvkjbet7k.avif)

DeepSeek is way ahead, raking in a solid 37% return with its data-driven strategy, while GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are bleeding money. Guizang's brilliant breakdown of this ["AI Stock God" Contest (AI News)](https://x.com/op7418/status/1980262012434452582) vividly showcases the vastly different "trading philosophies" of these AI models. üìâüìà<br/>![AI News: Live Status of AI Crypto Trading Competition](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k811r30gf0nvpm1p4m8tmm9e.avif)

2.  DeepSeek OCR's paper, with its "optical compression" idea simulating human memory and forgetting mechanisms, is pure genius! orange.ai shared that by using different image resolutions to represent memories from different timeframes, the model can achieve a "theoretically infinite context window" because information naturally decays over time. This [Brilliant Analogy (AI News)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1980257405222142056) makes us rethink the long-context problem: maybe the trick isn't endlessly expanding memory, but learning to "forget" intelligently. üß†<br/>![AI News: DeepSeek OCR's Optical Compression Concept](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k811r60rfdba3znsdv58y33c.avif)

3.  The AI open-source community is getting swamped by trash code from "vibe coding"‚Äîwhat's the business model behind this? Yangyi sharply points out that many seemingly open-source projects are actually just using flashy demos to draw you in, with the ultimate goal of getting you to buy their "better" paid SaaS services. This [Sharp Critique (AI News)](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1980260113907953693) exposes the chaos in the AI open-source ecosystem, reminding us to keep our eyes peeled even when embracing open source. üßê

4.  Why is AI always drawing and dancing instead of helping us clean or cook? Yangyi offered a profound observation: because stepping into real-world production is incredibly tough, demanding countless meticulous details, while abstract artistic creation is the easiest and most shareable. This [Post (AI News)](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1980157337232122028) resonated widely, highlighting the massive chasm between AI's "show-off" capabilities and practical utility. üßë‚Äçüíª<br/><video src="https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k811rnxcf27b2a5nhk6w24sc.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video>
