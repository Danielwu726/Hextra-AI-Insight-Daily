# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! üëã This Privacy Policy breaks down how we collect, use, and spill the beans (oops, we mean disclose!) your info when you're chilling with our Service. It's also here to tell you all about your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

We totally use your personal data to make our Service awesome and keep it running smoothly. By jumping on board and using our Service, you're essentially giving us a nod of approval to collect and use your info, all according to this Privacy Policy. Cool? üòé

## Explanations & Definitions

### Let's Get Specific
Okay, so when you see capitalized words, they've got meanings defined right here. And nope, whether they're singular or plural, these definitions stay the same. Easy peasy! üëá

### The Lowdown on Terms
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, here's the 411 on what we mean:

- **Account** means that special, unique login you create to hop onto our Service or any cool parts of it.

- **Affiliate** means any entity that's got some sway over us, is swayed by us, or is swayed alongside us. Think of "control" here as owning 50% or more of the voting power ‚Äì like shares, equity, or other securities that elect big shots like directors.

- **Company** (that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement) means **hubtoday**. Yep, that's us!

- **Cookies** are those tiny files websites stash on your computer, phone, or whatever gadget you're using. They hold bits of your browsing history on that site, among other things.

- **Country** means: California, USA. üá∫üá∏

- **Device** means any tech gadget that can get you to our Service, like your computer, smartphone, or digital tablet.

- **Personal Data** is basically any info linked to a person who can be identified or is already identified.

- **Service** means this very Website you're on right now.

- **Service Provider** means any person or company that crunches data for us. We're talking about third-party companies or individuals we hire to help run the Service, provide services for us, or even help us figure out how you're using it. They're our helping hands!

- **Usage Data** is that info collected automatically, either from you using the Service or from the Service's tech backbone itself. Think stuff like how long you hang out on a certain page.

- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can find right over at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** means, well, *you*! The person using or checking out our Service. Or, if you're doing this for a company or another legal entity, then "You" means them.

## Collecting & Using Your Personal Data

### The Data Types We Collect

#### Personal Data (The Nitty-Gritty)
When you're using our Service, we might ask you for some personal identification info that helps us get in touch with you or figure out who you are. This personal info could include, but isn't limited to, things like:

- Email address
- Usage data

#### Usage Data (Auto-Collected Stuff)
Usage data? That's the stuff we automatically collect when you're using the Service. No extra effort needed from you!

Usage data can cover things like your device's Internet Protocol address (think IP address), what kind of browser you're rocking and its version, which pages you checked out on our Service, when you visited and for how long, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic bits and bobs.

When you're accessing the Service from your mobile device, we might automatically grab some extra info. This includes, but again, isn't limited to: the type of mobile device you're using, its unique ID, your mobile IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. Phew, that's a mouthful! üì±

Whether you're visiting our Service or hitting it up on mobile, we might also collect information that your browser sends our way.

### Tracking Tech & Cookies (Yup, We Use 'Em!)
We're all about using Cookies and other similar tracking technologies to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. These tracking tools include things like beacons, tags, and scripts, and they're super helpful for collecting and tracking data, plus making our Service even better and analyzing how it's used. The tech we might use includes:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a tiny file popped onto your device. You can totally tell your browser to say 'nope!' to all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But, heads up, if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work perfectly for you. Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to reject 'em, our Service might just use Cookies by default.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have these little electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These clever files let us, for example, count users who've visited certain pages or opened an email, and they're also used for other cool website stats, like seeing how popular a section is and making sure our systems and servers are all good.

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. When you're offline, Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device. Session Cookies? Those vanish the second you close your web browser. Poof! ‚ú®

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these purposes:

- **Essential / Necessary Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely vital for us to deliver the services available through the Website and to let you use its awesome features. They're super important for authenticating users and keeping those pesky fraudulent account uses at bay. Without these Cookies, the services you're asking for just wouldn't work, and we *only* use them to give you those specific services. No funny business!

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Notice Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to check if users have given us the green light to use Cookies on the Website. It's like a little 'I accept' sticky note! ‚úÖ

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super handy because they help us remember choices you've made while using the Website, like keeping your login info saved or knowing your language preference. The whole point of these is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to re-enter your preferences every single time you visit. Sweet! üß†

For even more juicy details on the Cookies we use and what choices you've got regarding them, feel free to swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy. It's all there!

### How We Use Your Personal Data
The Company might use your personal data for these reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service** (yep, that includes keeping an eye on how it's used!).
- **To manage Your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you get access to all sorts of cool features only available to registered users. ‚ú®
- **To get contracts done**: We use your data to create, stick to, and fulfill purchase contracts for any products, items, or services you've bought, or any other agreements made with us via the Service.
- **To hit you up**: We might contact you via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic communication (like push notifications from a mobile app!) to give you updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for ‚Äì including those crucial security updates ‚Äì whenever it's necessary or makes sense. üìßüìû
- **To send you cool stuff**: Think newsletters, special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we offer that are similar to what you've already bought or asked about. Of course, this is unless you've told us you'd rather not get these updates. Your call! üóûÔ∏è
- **To handle your requests**: Pretty straightforward ‚Äì this is all about processing and managing any requests you send our way.
- **For business transfers**: Your info might be used if we're evaluating or going through a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as an ongoing business or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceedings, where the Personal Data we hold about our Service users is one of the assets being transferred. Big stuff!
- **For other cool reasons**: We might use your info for other purposes too, like crunching data, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promotions are hitting the mark, and generally tweaking and improving our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Always striving for better! üìà

We might also share your personal information in these scenarios:

- **With Service Providers**: We may share your Personal Data with Service Providers to monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and to get in touch with you.
- **For business transfers**: Your Personal Data might be shared or transferred during or in negotiations of any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. It's all part of business sometimes! ü§ù
- **With Affiliates**: We may share your info with our affiliates. When we do, we'll make sure those affiliates play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us. It's a family affair! üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
- **With business partners**: We might share your info with our business partners to hook you up with specific products, services, or promotions. Teamwork makes the dream work! üí™
- **With other users**: If you spill your Personal Data or chat with other users in our public areas, that info might be seen by all users and could even be made public outside of our Service. Just a heads up! üó£Ô∏è
- **With your consent**: With your explicit permission, we might dish out your personal info for any other reason you agree to. Your say, your way! üëç

### Keeping Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your personal data for as long as it's truly needed for the reasons laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal duties (like if we gotta keep your data to follow applicable laws), settle disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. Gotta play by the rules! ‚öñÔ∏è

The Company also keeps Usage Data for internal analysis. Typically, Usage Data doesn't stick around for long, unless it's being used to boost the security of our Service, jazz up its functionality, or if we're legally obligated to hold onto it for a longer stretch.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. What does this mean? It means your info might get shuttled over to ‚Äî and stored on ‚Äî computers outside of your State, Province, Country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws might be different from yours. Wild, right? üåç

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving us your A-OK for that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info. Your safety is our priority! üîí

### Wiping Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete your Personal Data, or ask us to help you wipe the slate clean of the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you delete certain bits of info about yourself right from within the Service itself. How convenient is that?

You can always log into your account (if you've got one) and head over to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. From there, you can update, tweak, or delete your info whenever you want. Or, if you prefer, just give us a shout to request access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

But, keep in mind, sometimes we might need to hold onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so. Can't always delete everything instantly! üòâ

### When We Might Disclose Your Personal Data

#### Business Deals
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. Don't worry, though; we'll totally give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. Transparency is key! üîë

#### The Law Steps In
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) make a valid request. We gotta follow the rules, too! üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe that such action is necessary to:
- Play by the legal rules
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or investigate potential wrongdoing connected to the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Shield ourselves from legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe (We Try Our Best!)
The security of your Personal Data is super important to us, no doubt! But here's the thing to remember: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. It's the internet, after all! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Kiddo Privacy (13 & Under)
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from anyone younger than 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please hit us up! If we ever find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers. Promise! üôè

If we ever need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might just ask for your parent's approval before we collect and use that info. Just making sure everyone's on the same page!

## Links to Other Websites (Heads Up!)
Our Service might have links that lead to other websites not run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We *highly* recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry!

We have zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just keeping it real! üö´

## Changes to This Privacy Policy (It Happens!)
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service. We'll also update that "Last Updated" date at the very top of this Privacy Policy. You won't miss it!

We recommend you give this Privacy Policy a regular peek to catch any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted right here on this page.
