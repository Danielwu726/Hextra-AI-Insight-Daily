*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! This Privacy Policy is here to tell you all about how we handle your info when you use our Service. It covers our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your data. Plus, it'll clue you in on your privacy rights and how the law has your back.

So, what do we do with your personal data? We use it to provide and improve our awesome Service! By hopping on board and using the Service, you're giving us the thumbs up to collect and use your info, all according to this Privacy Policy.

## Explanations & Definitions

### Explanations
Just a heads-up: words capitalized in this document have specific meanings, which you'll find defined below. These definitions hold true whether the words show up as singular or plural. Easy peasy!

### Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** refers to that special, unique account we whip up for you so you can jump into our Service or parts of it.

- **Affiliate** is basically any entity that's got control over us, we control, or we're both under the same control. "Control" in this context means owning 50% or more of the voting shares, equity, or other securities for electing directors or managers. Think of them as our extended family!

- **Company** (that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement) is none other than **hubtoday**.

- **Cookies** are just these tiny little files a website pops onto your computer, phone, or any other gadget. They stash bits of info, like your browsing history on that site, for all sorts of reasons.

- **Country** refers to: California, USA. 🇺🇸

- **Device** is any gadget you use to get into our Service – think computers, mobile phones, or even your trusty tablet.

- **Personal Data** is simply any info that relates to someone who's already identified or can be identified. You know, stuff about *you*!

- **Service**? That's just our fancy word for this Website.

- **Service Provider** is anyone – a person or a company – who processes data for us. Think of them as the awesome third-party folks we hire to help run the Service, deliver it for us, handle tasks related to it, or even just help us figure out how you're using it.

- **Usage Data** is the info that gets automatically scooped up whenever you use our Service, or even from the Service's tech setup itself. Things like how long you hang out on a certain page, for instance.

- **Website** refers to **hubtoday**, which you can find chilling over at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** (yes, YOU!) means the awesome individual checking out or using our Service. Or, if you're doing it on behalf of a company or other legal crew, then it refers to them.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're diving into our Service, we might ask you for some personally identifiable info. This is stuff we can use to get in touch or figure out who you are. This personal info *could* include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's the stuff that gets automatically scooped up whenever you use our Service. No extra effort from you needed!

So, what might Usage Data include? It could be your Device's Internet Protocol address (like an IP address), your browser type and version, which pages of our Service you visited, the exact time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other techy diagnostic bits.

Heads up for mobile users! If you're accessing our Service via your mobile device, we might automatically grab some info. This *could* include things like the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. You get the picture!

Oh, and by the way, we might also collect info that your browser sends over, whether you're hitting up our Service on a desktop or through your mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
So, about those Cookies and tracking tech! We use them – and other similar stuff – to keep tabs on activity on our Service and to stash away some info. These technologies, like beacons, tags, and scripts, help us collect and track data, ultimately making our Service better and helping us analyze how it's being used. Here’s a peek at what we might use:

- **Cookies (or Browser Cookies, as some call 'em)**: Picture this: a Cookie is just a tiny file that lands on your Device. You totally have the power to tell your browser to reject all Cookies, or even give you a heads-up when one's trying to get sent. But, fair warning, if you don't play nice with Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work perfectly. Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to say "no thanks" to Cookies, our Service will likely be using them.
- **Web Beacons**: So, some parts of our Service and even our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear 'em called clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs). These little guys let us, for example, count how many users have checked out those pages or opened an email. They're also handy for other website stats, like seeing how popular a certain section is or making sure our systems and servers are running smoothly.

Cookies come in two main flavors: 'Persistent' and 'Session' Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on your computer or mobile device even after you've logged off, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We actually use both Session and Persistent Cookies, and here's why:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These are the absolute must-have Cookies! They're super important for getting our Website's services to you and letting you use some key features. Think of them as the bouncers for user authentication, keeping fraudulent account use out. Without these babies, the services you're asking for just wouldn't work, so we only use them to deliver the goods!

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies simply remember if you've already given us the green light to use Cookies on the Website. One less pop-up for you to deal with! 😉

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These are the clever Cookies that help us remember your choices when you're cruising around the Website – like your login info or what language you prefer. Their whole goal is to give you a smoother, more personalized experience, so you don't have to keep re-entering your preferences every single time. Handy, right?

Wanna dive deeper into the Cookies we use or tweak your choices? Just hit up our dedicated Cookies Policy or the Cookies section within this Privacy Policy. All the deets are there!

### How We Use Your Personal Data
So, the Company might use your Personal Data for these reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**: This includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used, just to make sure everything's running smoothly.
- **To manage your Account**: This is all about handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you unlock all sorts of cool features only available to registered users. Think of it as your VIP pass! 🎫
- **For the performance of a contract**: This means setting up, sticking to, and fulfilling the purchase contract for anything you buy from us (products, items, services) or any other agreement you make with us through the Service. It's all about making sure our deals are done right!
- **To contact You**: We might reach out to you via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic messages (like push notifications from our mobile app). This is usually for updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security updates – when it's absolutely necessary or just makes sense.
- **To provide You with news**: We love keeping you in the loop! So, we might send you news, special offers, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we're offering. This usually happens if they're similar to things you've already bought or shown interest in, unless you've told us to keep quiet. 😉
- **To manage Your requests**: We're here to help! This means dealing with and managing any requests you send our way. Consider us your personal support team.
- **For business transfers**: In the event of big company changes – like a merger, sale, or reorganization – we might use your info to help evaluate or carry out that transfer. This includes scenarios like bankruptcy or liquidation, where your Personal Data might be one of the assets changing hands. It's all part of the business game!
- **For other purposes**: Yep, we might also use your info for other stuff, like digging into data for analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are actually working, and generally making our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience even better. Always striving for improvement! ✨

Now, about when we might share your personal info. Here are the scenarios where that could happen:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers. They help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used and can even reach out to you on our behalf.
- **For business transfers**: If we're talking big business moves – like a merger, selling off company assets, financing, or another company buying us out – we might share or transfer your personal info during those negotiations or as part of the deal. Just so you know!
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliates – basically, companies related to us. Don't worry, though, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too! This includes our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture pals, or any other companies we control or are commonly controlled with.
- **With business partners**: Sometimes, we team up with business partners to bring you cool products, services, or promotions. In those cases, we might share your information with them.
- **With other users**: If you're sharing personal info or just chatting it up in public areas with other users, that info could be seen by everyone and even shared publicly outside our Service. So, be mindful of what you post! 🗣️
- **With Your consent**: And hey, if you give us the explicit go-ahead, we might disclose your personal info for any other purpose you agree to. It's all up to you!

### Retention of Your Personal Data
So, how long do we keep your Personal Data? The Company only holds onto it for as long as it's truly needed for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep and use your Personal Data to tick off our legal obligations (like if the law says we have to), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed. Pretty standard stuff!

The Company also hangs onto Usage Data for our own internal analysis. Generally, Usage Data sticks around for a shorter time. The only exceptions are if we're using that data to boost our Service's security, make its features even better, or if we're legally required to keep it for longer. Safety first! 🔒

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
So, where does your info (including Personal Data) get processed? It happens at the Company's main offices and wherever else the folks involved in the processing are located. This means your info might zip over to, and be stored on, computers outside of your state, province, or country. Just a heads-up that the data protection laws in those other places might be different from yours.

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and sending us your info, you're essentially giving us the green light for that transfer to happen. Cool?

Rest assured, the Company will do everything reasonably necessary to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We're super strict: we won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're confident they have solid controls in place, especially when it comes to the security of your data and other personal info. Your safety is our priority! 🛡️

### Deleting Your Personal Data
Good news! You have the right to delete your Personal Data that we've collected, or you can ask us to help you with that. It's your data, your call! 🙋‍♀️

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info directly from within the platform. Pretty neat, huh?

You can update, tweak, or delete your info anytime by logging into your account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section where you can manage your personal data. Or, if you prefer, just ping us! You can request to access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us. We're here to help!

Just a quick heads-up: we might sometimes need to hold onto certain info if we have a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so. Some things just have to stick around!

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
Big news! If the Company ever gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred too. But don't sweat it – we'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy. Transparency is key!

#### Law enforcement
Just so you know, there are some situations where the Company might have to spill your Personal Data. This usually happens if the law demands it, or if we get a valid request from public authorities, like a court or a government agency. We gotta follow the rules!

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
- **Comply with a legal obligation**: Gotta follow the rules, right?
- **Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company**: We need to keep our stuff safe and sound.
- **Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service**: If something shady's going down, we might need to look into it.
- **Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public**: Your safety, and everyone else's, is super important!
- **Protect against legal liability**: Helps us avoid getting into legal hot water.

### Security of Your Personal Data
Listen, the security of your Personal Data is a *huge* deal to us! But let's be real: no method of sending data over the internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% bulletproof. We seriously go all out to use top-notch, commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, but we just can't promise it'll be absolutely, perfectly secure every single time. We're doing our best! 🤞

## Children's Privacy
Quick heads-up about kids: Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. Seriously, we don't knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from anyone that young. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your kid has given us Personal Data, please, *please* get in touch! If we discover we've accidentally collected Personal Data from someone under 13 without parental consent, we'll quickly wipe that info from our servers. Promise!

And if we need your consent to process your info, and your country says a parent needs to give that consent, we might just ask your parent's permission before we collect and use that info. Just playing by the rules!

## Links to Other Websites
Heads up! Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't actually run. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. So, we totally recommend checking out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry! 😉

Just to be clear: we have zero control over, and take absolutely no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. They're on their own!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
Heads up! We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. When we do, we'll let you know by simply posting the fresh new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any changes officially kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update that "Last Updated" date at the very top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises here!

We recommend you peek at this Privacy Policy every now and then to catch any changes. Just remember, once we post changes on this page, they're officially in effect!
