So, Google and OpenAI just dropped some fresh updates for their video generation models! 🤩 Here's the lowdown on the main changes:

## Google Veo 3.1

Google's Veo model just got a spiffy update to version 3.1! ✨ It packs three core functionalities that are pretty wild:

1.  First up, Veo can now **blend multiple images to cook up a video**. 🤯 You can feed the AI a few separate pics – say, a person and a cool background. Veo then masterfully stitches them together into one dynamic video, placing the person right into that background, and even automatically adding sound! How neat is that?

2.  Veo also offers a killer feature to **extend your video clips**. 🚀 This function takes a short video and stretches it out. It analyzes the final frame, then keeps generating fresh content from that exact point, ensuring seamless continuity in visuals and motion. Using this trick, you can even whip up videos longer than a minute! Talk about epic storytelling.

3.  And get this: Veo can now **generate transitions based on just your start and end frames**. 🎬 Simply hand it an opening shot and a closing shot. Veo then automatically fills in all the juicy transitional bits in between, crafting a complete video for you. Smooth!

These snazzy features are now live and kicking on the FlowbyGoogle platform and within the Gemini API. Go check 'em out! 👇

## OpenAI Sora 2

Sora's update is a bit more subtle, focusing on two key points: 👀

1.  First up, Sora has officially **launched its Storyboard feature**. 📝 Paid Pro users can now dive into this functionality directly on the web. Pretty sweet!

2.  Secondly, Sora is **increasing video generation duration**. More footage for everyone! 🎉
    *   For starters, all users (that's both free and paid folks!) can now generate videos up to 15 seconds long.
    *   And for our Pro users, especially on the web interface, you can now crank out videos up to a whopping 25 seconds! Get creating! 🚀
